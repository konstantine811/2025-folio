And then — build interactive worlds and three-dimensional stories. Place it in space: the Universe of the Web, where every line of code is like a detective trail, leading wherever your imagination takes you. And do not be deceived by the thought that your years have passed, or that school failed to teach you enough — just act. And then you discover true weapons: <tech>React</tech>, <tech>Node.js</tech>, and <tech>Three.js</tech>; the world of interactive maps with <tech>Mapbox</tech>; animations powered by <tech>Framer Motion</tech> or <tech>GSAP</tech>.
