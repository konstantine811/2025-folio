In the CGBoost <em>Cubic Worlds</em> course and several Udemy lessons, I gained practical skills: environment modeling, basic shader creation, animation, character rigging, and much more.</p><p>Right now I feel that in this field almost nothing is impossible for me — all I need is time and a good idea.</p><p>On my blog, I’ve prepared full-length articles with step-by-step instructions for modeling <em>Cubic Worlds</em> — from the very first steps to building complete 3D scenes. You’re welcome to explore them here: <link>My Cubic Worlds blog</link>.</p>",
        "three_js": "<p>For over <em>4 years</em>, I have been deeply engaged in both the theory and practice of <strong>Three.js</strong>. The most valuable learning experiences came from the <a_simon>Simon Bruno – Journey to Three.js</a_simon> course and the unique materials by <a_sensei>WawaSensei</a_sensei> (both public on YouTube and private), which covered a wide range of techniques and approaches in creating 3D applications.</p><p>I also expanded my knowledge of low-level <strong>WebGL</strong> and experimented with shaders, which still feel somewhat magical to me. Another area of strong interest is working with physics: I have experience with <strong>Rapier</strong>, as well as <strong>Cannon.js</strong> and <strong>Ammo.js</strong>.</p><p>The biggest breakthrough for me was discovering <strong>React Three Fiber</strong> and <strong>React Drei</strong> — tools that significantly simplify building 3D scenes in <strong>React</strong> and enable fast experimentation. During this time, I have created many pet projects and experiments, and through practice I realized that what excites me the most is creating 3D environments and games.</p><p>I also explored <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>Babylon.js</strong>, but my love for JavaScript and the ease of working with <strong>React Three Fiber</strong> always brought me back. I believe that web-based games and interactive 3D experiences still hold a tremendous future.</p> <a>Here you can also check out my latest <strong>Three.js</strong> examples.</a>",
        "three_js_examples": "Past projects hosted on other sites, not featured here",
        "backend_data": "<p>I’ve been working with <strong>Node.js</strong> practically since the start of my frontend career. I build lightweight backend services and <strong>APIs</strong>, and set up data storage and access across different databases—from document-oriented (<strong>MongoDB/JSON</strong>) to relational (<strong>SQL</strong>). Although backend isn’t my primary focus, I take on these tasks when there’s no one to delegate them to. On the frontend, I have strong hands-on experience with caching and offline mode: I actively use <strong>IndexedDB</strong> (in combination with <strong>service workers</strong>), enabling the application to work fully offline as long as synchronization is configured correctly. For state management, I have extensive experience with <strong>RxJS</strong> in <strong>Angular</strong> and <strong>Redux</strong> in both <strong>Angular</strong> and <strong>React</strong>; however, within the <strong>React</strong> ecosystem I prefer <strong>Zustand</strong> for its simplicity and because it’s sufficient for 100% of my use cases (<strong>Redux</strong> is used where it’s truly justified).</p>",
        "visual_data": "<p>I have extensive experience visualizing large datasets (<em>8,000+ records</em>) as interactive charts and tables. My primary tool is <strong>D3.js</strong>: I’ve implemented <em>synchronized multiple charts</em>, <em>zooming</em>, <em>tooltips/popups</em>, <em>custom icons</em>, <em>animations</em>, and <em>line</em> and <em>pie charts</em>. I’ve worked with other libraries as well, but I consider <strong>D3.js</strong> the best choice: it doesn’t lock you into a specific style and gives full freedom for features, though it can require more effort to implement.</p> <p>For tables, I primarily use <strong>AG Grid</strong>—<em>excellent documentation</em>, a <em>wide feature set</em>, <em>support for Angular/React/Vanilla JS/TS</em>, and easy <em>integration of custom components</em>. I’ve implemented <em>sorting</em>, <em>drag-and-drop</em>, and <em>custom filters</em>, among others. With <strong>AG Grid</strong>, I displayed data for about <em>8,000 fields</em> and <em>two-way synchronized selection and search with the map</em>—everything ran fast and reliably.</p>",
        "front_end": "<p>I’ve been “married” to <strong>JavaScript</strong> for nine years now—and I’ve never regretted the choice. Before that, I experimented with <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, but each time I ran into the feeling of being tied to a specific platform or set of features. <strong>JavaScript</strong> gave me what I was missing—freedom: at any moment I can change direction without a full reset—<em>Frontend</em>, <em>Backend</em>, <em>GameDev</em>, <em>ML/Machine Learning</em>, <em>Mobile</em>, <em>Desktop</em>, <em>Arduino/Robotics</em>.</p> <p>Yes, there are trade-offs—<strong>JS</strong> can trail compiled languages in performance—but the ecosystem rapidly covers most needs. That’s where <strong>TypeScript</strong>—my second professional “love”—has my back: it makes code transparent and predictable (the <em>any</em> type now appears only in nightmares), and scaling becomes much simpler.</p> <p>I’ve spent years working with <strong>Vue</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, and <strong>React</strong>; today my default choice is <strong>React</strong>. Paired with <strong>TypeScript</strong>, this stack lets me design reliable, scalable systems—from the <em>UI</em> to complex client-side logic and backend integrations.</p>",
        "ui": "<p>When I entered the web development world, the market was firmly dominated by <strong>Bootstrap</strong>. I never quite understood why: yes, before <em>flexbox</em> it offered a convenient grid system, but the design always felt outdated to me. On top of that, any deviation required adding “hacks,” since there was no flexible API at the time.</p> <p>Later, <strong>Material Design</strong> appeared — more visually appealing, but even harder to customize than <strong>Bootstrap</strong>.</p> <p>In recent years, <strong>Tailwind</strong> has emerged, and it’s exactly what was missing: it doesn’t impose a specific style, is fully customizable, well-optimized for bundling, and noticeably simplifies development. With <strong>Tailwind</strong>, I rarely write “pure” <em>CSS</em> anymore — most of my work is done with utility classes directly in the markup.</p> <p>On top of that, many UI libraries have been built around <strong>Tailwind</strong>; one of my favorites for its simplicity is <strong>shadcn/ui</strong>. Overall, I have <em>extensive experience</em> working with <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>Material</strong>, and <strong>Tailwind</strong>.</p>",
        "map": "<p>I have been working with <em>maps</em> professionally for <em>4–5 years</em>. My first real experience began at the company <em>Kernel</em>. At first, I didn’t even think I would enjoy this field so much, but after solving a few complex tasks related to calculating the overall geometry of multiple polygons (essentially the <em>convexHull</em> algorithm, which I didn’t even know about back then), I was completely hooked. I could ride the trolleybus and sketch algorithms on a fogged-up window, lost in thought. It was incredibly exciting.</p> <p>We worked with <strong>ArcGIS</strong>, since the company had been building solutions on that platform for many years, so there wasn’t much choice. Our main challenge was to display <em>8,000 fields</em> quickly and without delays. Essentially, we were creating something very similar to <em>Cropio</em>. After two years, when much had already been done, I managed to convince my colleagues to switch to <strong>Mapbox</strong>. It gave us the speed and interactivity we desperately needed. However, <strong>Mapbox</strong> lacked some of the <strong>ArcGIS</strong> features, such as <em>raster functions</em>, so my task was to combine both technologies. We succeeded brilliantly.</p> <p>Today, I have solid experience with both <strong>Mapbox</strong> and <strong>ArcGIS</strong>, though I personally prefer <strong>Mapbox</strong> for its simplicity and reliability. I have a strong understanding of <em>Mapbox expressions</em>, know how to integrate data from <strong>OpenStreetMap</strong> and <strong>ArcGIS</strong>, and how to add <em>3D objects</em> to the map.</p> <p>In my own pet projects, I rarely use maps — I don’t often come up with ideas for web apps involving them, and those experiments tend to remain rather superficial. But when I work with maps in real-world tasks, I get drawn in completely — just like in childhood, when I was absorbed by <em>Total War</em> games or books about explorers like <em>Francis Drake</em>, <em>James Cook</em>, or <em>Magellan</em>. When building maps, I feel like both a pirate and a discoverer.</p>",

Find and collect weapons (swords, rifles, staves), clothing, and items; store them in your own home and sell them at the market. On your journeys you’ll meet friends and enemies who will either help you or get in your way. Planned features include rooms for online play with friends or random players, as well as various types of transport: cars, robots, planes, helicopters (depending on the world).</p><p>The core idea is not only to complete quests but also to learn. Depending on the room, the game will explain scientific approaches, physics, mathematics, English, logic, algorithms, programming, history, and more—so the game is both engaging and useful.</p><p><em>What’s already done</em>: a <em>basic character controller</em>; a <em>world editor</em> (you can “paint” grass, soil, and other objects onto surfaces); <em>adding individual items and physics</em>; <em>user-linked saves</em>; the <em>character can perform basic attacks and break crates</em>. Next up: <em>enemies</em>, <em>item drops</em>, and <em>other mechanics</em>.</p><p>Planning to build your own world? Then head <a>here</a>.</p><p>If you’d like to support the development, have an interesting project for me, or want to collaborate—write to me. I’ll be glad to cooperate, hear your ideas, and get feedback. Below I’ll attach links to my social media and Patreon. Thanks for reading—see you! 😊</p>",
